## Types 

- ***Creational***
  - Creates object systematically, different types of object can be created at runtime
  - Polymorphism 
- ***Structural***
  - Establish relationship between software components, satisfy functional (achieve the implementation goals) and non functional (performance, resource usage) goals
  - Inheritance
- ***Behavioural***
  - Object interactions, protocols of interactions
  - Function signatures and parameters

> Note Design pattern build mostly on the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Context

- ***Participant***
  - Classes which are involved and Roles they play
- ***Quality Attributes***
  - Deals with Non Functional requirements, i.e. Reliability, Usability, Performance, Modifiability
- ***Forces***
  - Various factors trade-off to consider, could be for Quality
- ***Consequences***
  - Issues like performance

> It is upto developer to choose when to use Design Pattern considering consequences

## Language

- ***Name***
  - Gist of a pattern
- ***Context***
  - Scenario when we use the pattern, and when to use it
- ***Problem***
  - Design challenge pattern is addressing
- ***Solution***
  - pattern itself
- ***Related Pattern***
  - Similarity and difference of patterns

> Pattern described using Structure (relationship) and Behaviour (Interaction)
