# Guidelines

## Consistency 

- You should always choose same solution to a problem.
- Consistent codes are always less error prone.
- Identification of operational issue is quick and easy.
- Save cost of reinventing wheel.
- Software Architecture enforce consistency on the pattern.
- Framework also enforce design pattern for a solution for similar problems.

## Completeness

It is important to focus on the correctness of the result of the software component.

## Coupling and Cohesion

- Coupling is how much software components are connected.
- Cohesion is how much software components are independent.
- The goal should always be more Cohesion and less Coupling.


## Simplicity and Generality

- Simplicity for ease of use.
- Solution should be general enough to be reused.
- Sometimes it can lead to opt for a tradeoff.
